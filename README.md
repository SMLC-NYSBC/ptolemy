# Ptolemy
A Python machine learning and computer vision library for automating cryo-EM data collection. The accompanying paper is available on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01534). Ptolemy is designed to handle localization and scoring of squares in low-mag images (pixelsize of around 2000-5000 Angstroms/pixel) and holes in medium-mag images (100-1000 angstroms/pixel). It works on both gold and carbon holey, untilted grids.

## Functionality
Images and visualization are handled by the `Exposure` class in `ptolemy/images.py`, with algorithms for processing low and medium mag images in `ptolemy/algorithms.py`. The workflow is outlined in the tutorial notebooks. 

## Future
We plan to improve Ptolemy with active learning on individual data collection sessions, support for tilted grids, and superresolution (unbinned) medium-mag images.
